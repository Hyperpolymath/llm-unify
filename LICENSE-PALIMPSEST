# Palimpsest Protocol License

## Data Portability and User Ownership

This license applies to user data handled by LLM Unify.

### Principles

1. **User Ownership**: Users absolutely own their conversation data
2. **Portability**: Data can be exported in standard formats (JSON)
3. **No Lock-in**: Users can migrate to other platforms at any time
4. **Privacy**: Data never leaves the user's machine
5. **Reversibility**: Users can delete all data at any time

### Guarantees

LLM Unify guarantees:

- ✅ All user data stays local (no cloud sync)
- ✅ Export functionality (`llm-unify export`)
- ✅ Delete functionality (`llm-unify delete`)
- ✅ Standard JSON format for exports
- ✅ No proprietary lock-in formats
- ✅ No AI training on user data (see .well-known/ai.txt)

### User Rights

Users of LLM Unify have the right to:

1. **Access**: View all their data at any time
2. **Export**: Extract data in portable format
3. **Delete**: Remove all traces of their data
4. **Modify**: Edit their local database directly
5. **Transfer**: Move data to other platforms
6. **Privacy**: Keep data completely private

### Implementation

LLM Unify implements these rights through:

- Local SQLite database (user controls file)
- JSON export format (universal compatibility)
- Delete commands (conversation-level and full wipe)
- No network dependencies (offline-first)
- Open source (AGPL-3.0 for code)

### No Exceptions

There are NO exceptions to user data ownership:

- ❌ No mandatory cloud sync
- ❌ No analytics or telemetry
- ❌ No AI training on user data
- ❌ No proprietary formats
- ❌ No vendor lock-in

### Enforcement

This data portability commitment is enforced by:

1. **Architecture**: Local-first design (no network calls)
2. **License**: AGPL-3.0 copyleft for code
3. **RSR Compliance**: Offline-first requirement
4. **Community**: Open governance model
